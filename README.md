# Hello! o/ 

## About Me:

🐭 I'm Gerry~ 
🏮 Recently turned 25 and currently trying to find my "ikigai"_(Japanese saying for 'life's purpose')._
🔍 I spend most of my free time reading on the internet and brainstorming. I love spending time on the PC and I recently put together with huge help from a friend giving instructions and being patient with me on 
Discord. Recently have been getting into project management and since the PC upgrade and finally more monitors, I am enjoying sitting down and trying to code stuff for fun more and more lately.
💻 I love chilling out with games sometimes too like WoW, League & Osu. Have started combining them with some streaming on Twitch and Tiktok pretty casually while blasting music and chatting with other weird nerds. I am still fairly new and pepega at it and the bad lighting makes my dark circles stand out even more. 
🎧 Occupation: Customer Service for 2.5-ish years now and recently switched to a new workplace and it is looking like a place I would love to hang around and see what's going on. I like working cs, cause it helps me improve and keep a lot of my normally weak points in shape - communication, patience and empathy. Also.. helping people is pretty awesome and feels awesome, too.😅
🦊 I have the cutest doggie in the world and she looks like a white foxy, which is why I used that emote. Her name is Megumi and she is a German Spitz - Medium.
